    content: `## Beyond Transplants

Imagine a world where instead of waiting for an organ transplant, we could grow a new one for you from your own cells. What if we could repair a damaged heart after a heart attack or regenerate spinal cord tissue to reverse paralysis?

This isn't science fiction. This is the goal of **Tissue Engineering**, a field that aims to build biology from the ground up.`,

    content: `## What is Tissue Engineering?

Tissue Engineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies the principles of engineering and life sciences toward the development of biological substitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function.

At its core, it's about combining three key ingredients. This is known as the **Tissue Engineering Triad**.`,

1.  **Cells:** The living "bricks" or factories that will build the new tissue.
2.  **Scaffold:** A 3D material, like a construction framework, that gives the cells a place to live, grow, and organize.
3.  **Signals:** The biochemical or physical "instructions" that tell the cells what to do (e.g., "grow," "become bone," "form a blood vessel").`,

    content: `## Why Do We Need It?

The demand for organ transplants far outstrips the supply. Millions of people suffer from tissue loss or organ failure due to injury, disease, or aging.

Tissue engineering offers a potential solution that avoids the problems of donor shortages and immune rejection, as tissues could ideally be grown from a patient's own cells.`,

    content: `## The Goal: From Benchtop to Bedside

The ultimate aim is to take these engineered tissues from the laboratory bench and use them in clinical practice at the patient's bedside. We've already had successes with simpler tissues like skin, cartilage, and bladders.

But engineering complex organs like a heart or a kidney remains a massive challenge.`,

You've got the big picture. You know the three essential components for building new tissue.

Now, let's zoom in on the most important ingredient: the cells. Where do we get them? What kind do we need? Let's meet the living bricks of tissue engineering.`,
