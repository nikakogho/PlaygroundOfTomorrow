The **spinal cord** is a long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue that extends from the brainstem down the back. It serves two primary functions:
1.  It's the main pathway for information connecting the brain and the peripheral nervous system.
2.  It can mediate **reflexes** on its own, without input from the brain.`,

    content: `## The Reflex Arc

Imagine you touch a hot stove. You pull your hand away *before* you even feel the pain. How? Sensory neurons in your skin send a signal up to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, an **interneuron** immediately passes that signal to a motor neuron, which tells the muscles in your arm to contract. This simple loop is a **reflex arc**. The signal only travels to the brain *after* the action has already occurred.`,

Sitting atop the spinal cord is the **brainstem**. This is the most ancient and basic part of the brain, and it's in charge of all the functions your body needs to stay aliveâ€”functions you never have to think about. It consists of three main parts: the medulla, the pons, and the midbrain.`,

- **Medulla Oblongata:** The lowest part of the brainstem, it controls the most vital functions like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.
- **Pons:** The "bridge" that relays information between the cerebellum and the rest of the brain. It's also involved in sleep, dreaming, and facial expressions.
- **Midbrain:** Contains circuits for vision and hearing, and is the origin of major dopamine pathways.`,

Just behind the brainstem sits a densely packed structure that is crucial for all coordinated movement. In the next module, we'll explore the cerebellum, the brain's "little brain" that acts as the master of motion.`,
