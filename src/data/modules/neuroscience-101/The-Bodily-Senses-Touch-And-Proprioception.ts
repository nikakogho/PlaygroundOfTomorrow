    content: `## The Somatosensory System

The **somatosensory system** is a catch-all term for the senses related to the body. This includes touch, pressure, vibration, temperature, and pain. Your skin is your largest sensory organ, embedded with a wide variety of specialized receptors to detect these different stimuli. The signals travel up the spinal cord to the **somatosensory cortex** in the parietal lobe.`,

    content: `## The Sense of Pain (Nociception)

Pain is a crucial survival signal. It's not just "more touch." It's detected by its own specialized receptors called **nociceptors**, which respond to potentially damaging stimuli (extreme heat, pressure, or chemicals). There are two main types of pain fibers: fast-acting ones for sharp, immediate pain, and slower ones for dull, throbbing pain.`,

    content: `## Your Secret Sixth Sense: Proprioception

Pause for a moment. Close your eyes. Now, touch your right index finger to the tip of your nose. How did you do that without seeing? You have a sense called **proprioception**â€”your brain's awareness of where your body parts are in space. This information comes from specialized receptors in your muscles and joints that constantly report on muscle stretch and joint position.`,

We have now explored how the brain receives information from the outside world and from the body itself. But the brain isn't a passive receiver; it changes with experience. In the next module, we'll dive into one of the most fascinating topics in neuroscience: how the brain learns and remembers.`,
