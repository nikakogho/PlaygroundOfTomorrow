*A Brilliant-style learning platform for hard-tech frontiers.*

## Vision
PlaygroundOfTomorrow will host **domains → courses → modules** spanning neurotech, space tech, biotech, nanotech, robotics, and AI.  
Learners progress by completing interactive modules that unlock the next, while their achievements are stored in Firebase/Firestore.  
Creators (starting with me) will author content in MDX, embed custom React widgets, attach starter-code ZIPs, and manage prerequisites through an **admin interface** in the same repo.

## Repo layout (MVP)

```
/
├─ frontend/ # Public Next.js app (learner-facing)
│ └─ (created by create-next-app)
├─ admin/ # Future content-authoring interface
│ └─ README.md
├─ README.md # you’re here
```
