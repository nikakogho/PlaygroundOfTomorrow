## All or None: The Action Potential

When a neuron receives enough stimulation from its dendrites, it fires an **action potential**. This is a rapid, temporary reversal of the membrane potential that travels down the axon like a wave. It's an "all-or-none" event; the neuron either fires at full strength or not at all.

This process starts when the inside of the neuron reaches a **threshold** of about -55mV.

Once the threshold is reached, voltage-gated ion channels spring into action, causing a predictable sequence of events:

1.  **Depolarization**: Voltage-gated **sodium (Na⁺)** channels open wide. Since there's a high concentration of Na⁺ outside the cell, it rushes **in**, causing the inside of the neuron to become rapidly positive (up to about +40mV).
2.  **Repolarization**: The Na⁺ channels close, and voltage-gated **potassium (K⁺)** channels open. Now, K⁺ rushes **out** of the cell, causing the membrane potential to fall and become negative again.
3.  **Hyperpolarization**: The K⁺ channels are a bit slow to close, so the potential briefly dips even more negative than the resting potential before the Na⁺/K⁺ pump restores the balance.

The rapid influx of which ion causes the initial depolarization phase?

Perfect. The flood of sodium makes the neuron fire.

During the repolarization phase, which ion rushes *out* of the cell to make it negative again?
