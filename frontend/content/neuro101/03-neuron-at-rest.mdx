## Charging Up: The Resting Potential

When a neuron is not sending a signal, it's considered to be "at rest." But it's not inactive! It's busy maintaining a stable electrical charge across its membrane, known as the **resting membrane potential**.

This charge is typically around **-70 millivolts (mV)**, meaning the inside of the neuron is 70mV more negative than the outside. This negative state is crucial for being ready to fire a signal.

How does the neuron maintain this negative charge? Two key players are at work:

1.  **The Sodium-Potassium (Na⁺/K⁺) Pump**: This protein actively pumps 3 positive sodium ions (Na⁺) out of the cell for every 2 positive potassium ions (K⁺) it pumps in. This results in a net loss of positive charge inside the cell.
2.  **Potassium Leak Channels**: At rest, the membrane is far more permeable to K⁺ than to Na⁺. These "leak" channels allow K⁺ to flow out of the cell down its concentration gradient, leaving behind negative proteins and making the inside even more negative.

At rest, the membrane is most permeable to which ion?

Correct. The outflow of positive potassium ions is a primary reason for the negative resting state.

The active protein that pumps ions to maintain the concentration gradients is called the **____**-**____** pump.
