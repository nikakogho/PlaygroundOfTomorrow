# Cells & Membranes

Every neuron is wrapped in a **phospholipid bilayer**.  
That membrane:

* separates charge (acts like a capacitor)  
* contains ion channels (creates conductance)  
* maintains a resting potential of ~-70 mV through the Na⁺/K⁺ pump

## Interactive Playground _(coming soon)_

> _When widgets are ready, this section will show a slider that changes  
>  external K⁺ concentration and plots the Nernst potential in real time._

**Question:** What two forces drive ion movement across a membrane?  
*(Write your answer in the text box below and click “Mark complete” when finished.)*

{/*
hint: One is electrical, one is chemical.
answer: The electrical gradient (voltage) and the concentration (chemical) gradient.
