  # Cells & Membranes

  Every neuron is wrapped in a **phospholipid bilayer**.
  That membrane:

  * separates charge (acts like a capacitor)
  * contains ion channels (creates conductance)
  * maintains a resting potential of ~-70 mV through the Na⁺/K⁺ pump

  ## Sending Signals ⚡

  A neuron has several distinct parts, each with a specific function. The main cell body is the `soma`, `dendrites` receive signals, and another part transmits them away from the cell body.

  The part of the neuron that sends signals to other cells is called the **____**.

  <FillInTheBlank correctAnswer="axon">
    <Hint>It's the long, slender projection of a nerve cell.</Hint>
