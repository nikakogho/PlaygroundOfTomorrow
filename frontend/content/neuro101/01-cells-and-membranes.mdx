## Meet the Neuron

Welcome to the world inside your head! The brain is made of billions of specialized cells called **neurons**. Think of them as the tiny messengers that form a massive communication network, allowing you to think, feel, and act.

Every neuron has three main parts, each with a specific job:
* **Dendrites**: These are tree-like branches that act as antennas, receiving signals from other neurons.
* **Soma**: This is the neuron's cell body. It processes the incoming signals and decides whether to pass the message along.
* **Axon**: A long, cable-like extension that transmits the signal away from the soma to other neurons.

Let's check your understanding. Which part of the neuron is primarily responsible for *receiving* information from other cells?

<MultipleChoice correctAnswer={1}>
  <p>Dendrites</p>
  <p>Soma</p>
  <p>Axon</p>

Great! The dendrites are the input channels.

Now, once the soma processes a signal, it sends an electrical impulse down a long fiber to communicate with the next cell. This signal-transmitting fiber is called the **____**.
