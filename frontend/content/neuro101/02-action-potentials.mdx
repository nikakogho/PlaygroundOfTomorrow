## The Neuron's "Skin"

Every neuron is enclosed by a cell membrane. This isn't just a simple bag; it's a dynamic, intelligent barrier that controls everything that goes in and out of the cell.

This membrane is a **phospholipid bilayer**, which acts as a fantastic electrical insulator. It separates the electrically charged ions inside the neuron from those outside.

But if it's an insulator, how do ions get across?

Embedded within the membrane are specialized proteins called **ion channels**. These act like selective gates that only allow specific ions, such as Sodium (Na⁺) or Potassium (K⁺), to pass through. The opening and closing of these gates is the key to all neuronal communication.

What are the protein-based "gates" that allow ions to cross the neuron's membrane called?

Exactly. The combination of the insulating membrane and the selective ion channels gives the neuron its unique electrical properties, which we'll explore next.
