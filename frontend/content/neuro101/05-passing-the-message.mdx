## The Synapse

An action potential is great, but it's useless unless the message can be passed to the next neuron. Neurons don't actually touch; they are separated by a microscopic gap called the **synapse**.

When the action potential reaches the end of the axon (the axon terminal), it triggers the release of chemical messengers.

These chemical messengers are called **neurotransmitters**.

They are released from the first neuron (the presynaptic cell), travel across the synaptic gap, and bind to **receptors** on the dendrites of the next neuron (the postsynaptic cell). This binding opens ion channels on the receiving neuron, starting the electrical signal all over again.

What are the chemical messengers that travel across the synapse called?

You got it!

The tiny, fluid-filled gap that separates one neuron from the next is called the **____**.

Congratulations! You've now followed a neural signal from the dendrite of one neuron, down its axon as an action potential, and across the synapse to the next cell. You understand the fundamentals of neuroscience!
